## Notes for Certification

```
NextGallery is a local image/video gallery application that does not connect to the internet for its core functionality.

The app requires 'runFullTrust' capability to access the file system for reading images from user-selected folders.

Optional FFmpeg integration is for local video thumbnail generation only.

No account, login, or internet connection required for normal use.
